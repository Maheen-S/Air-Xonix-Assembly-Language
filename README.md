# Air-Xonix-Assembly-Language
This project focuses on developing a modern version of the classic game called Air Xonix using MASM615 assembly language. The game involves controlling a small flying spacedhip to cut off parts of the playing field by drawing lines while avoiding enemies and obstacles. The objective is to reach the end of each level by cutting off a certain percentage of the playing field. The project includes implementing two levels with increasing difficulty, each featuring unique characters, obstacles, and time constraints.

Level 1:
Players control a small spaceship in a space-themed playing field.
The goal is to cut off at least 50% of the playing field within 60 seconds.
Various enemies, obstacles, and power-ups are encountered.
Scoring is based on the percentage of the playing field cut off and enemies destroyed.

Level 2:
Builds upon Level 1 with increased difficulty.
Spaceship, enemies, and obstacles are enhanced.
Time limit is reduced to 40 seconds.

User Interface:
Includes start screen, game menu screen, high score screen, instruction screen, and pause screen.
Displays player's score, remaining lives, and time remaining during gameplay.
After completing a level, displays score, level, and option to proceed to the next level or return to the main menu.

File Handling:
Utilizes file handling to store player scores, levels completed, time remaining, remaining lives, and highest score in a file.
